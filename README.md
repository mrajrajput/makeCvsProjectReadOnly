# makeCvsProjectReadOnly
This document tells you how to make a specific project read-only from CVS repository.

## Why do we need to make a specific repository as read-only out of CVS Server.
> When we don't want to allow any change in specific CVS repository.

> We can enforce coding standard in a team

> When we are moving to other Repository server(example GIT) and forcing developers to use new repository.
